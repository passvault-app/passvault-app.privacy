  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective date: 12/08/23</p>
  <p>The purpose of this document is to outline the privacy policy of the Passvault Password Manager mobile application, which will hereafter be referred to as the ‘Service’, and outlines how the personal data you provide to the Service is used, stored, and protected.</p>
  <p>The Service is operated by Samuel Coco (“us”, “we”, “our”).</p>

  <h1>Data Collection</h1>
  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> data collection under this policy is defined as the collection and transmission of any user provided personal data provided to the Service off a user’s device.</p>
  <p>The Service collects no data. All personal data provided to the Service remains locally on the user’s device and is not transmitted to any servers, external services, or third-party organizations. The Service does not gather any user information or personal data for the purposes of app analytics, although such data may be collected by Google Ad Mob, solely for the purpose of serving Ad banners. All data provided to the Service is used solely for the purpose of fulfilling the functionality of the Service.</p>
  <!-- ... more content ... -->
  <h1>Data Security</h1>
  <p>All sensitive information provided to the Service is stored locally on the user’s device and encrypted with AES-256 encryption, specifically the following sensitive information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Usernames</li>
    <li>Passwords</li>
    <li>URLs</li>
    <li>Bank names</li>
    <li>All provided Debit or Credit card information</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As all user data is stored locally on the device, we do not have access to any data provided by the user to the Service. The aim of this Service is to provide an added layer of security by providing a password management service that is completely offline with no interactions with any web servers which are vulnerable to attacks by malicious third-parties. We have taken all steps possible to ensure that the application and user data is secure and protected, but no system is guaranteed to be impenetrable to attacks by malicious actors, including this Service.</p>

  <h1>Data Management, Retention & Deletion</h1>
  <p>We do not manage or have access to any user data, therefore data retention policies do not apply. Users have full management and control of any data they provide to the Service. Deleting entries in the Service will permanently delete that data from the Service and its database. Un-installing the Service fully from a user device will wipe all data provided to the Service as well as removing the Service from the user's device.</p>
  <!-- ... more content ... -->
  <h1>Policy Updates</h1>
  <p>This privacy policy may be subject to change in the future. Please regularly review this page for information on such subsequent changes: any future changes in policy take effect on the date they are posted.</p>

  <h1>Third-Party Services</h1>
  <p>The Service may use Google Ad Mob to serve Banner Ads but only via non-personalised ads to collect as little user data as possible.</p>
  <p>Details on Google Ad Mob’s privacy policy can be found <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en">here</a>.</p>
